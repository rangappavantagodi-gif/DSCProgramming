# String Concatenation Program in C

## 📖 Description
This is a simple C program that demonstrates how to **concatenate two string arrays** (first name and last name) into a single full name using standard C string functions (`strcpy` and `strcat`).

The program:
- Prompts the user to enter a first name and a last name.
- Concatenates them with a space in between.
- Displays the full name as output.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- Basic knowledge of compiling and running C programs.

---

## 🚀 Compilation & Execution
### Compile the program:
```bash
gcc concat_strings.c -o concat_strings

Run the program:
./concat_strings


🧪 Example Run
--Concatinate two string arrays--
Enter first name:
John
Enter last name:
Doe
Full Name: John Doe

🔑 Key Concepts Used
- scanf for user input.
- strcpy to copy the first string into the destination.
- strcat to append strings.
- Character arrays for string storage.
