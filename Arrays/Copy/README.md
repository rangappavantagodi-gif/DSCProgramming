Copy Elements from One Array to Another in C
📌 Description

This program demonstrates how to copy elements from one integer array to another using a simple for loop in the C programming language.

The user:

Enters the number of elements

Inputs elements into the first array

Copies those elements into a second array

Displays the copied array




▶️ How to Build and Run

Use a standard C compiler such as GCC to compile and execute the program.

🧠 Overview

Two arrays arr1 and arr2 of size n are declared.

Elements are read into arr1 using scanf().

A for loop copies each element from arr1 to arr2.

The contents of arr2 are printed to confirm the copy operation.

🧪 Sample Input
5
10 20 30 40 50
📤 Sample Output
Elements of second array:
10 20 30 40 50
