📌 Program Title

Temperature Statistics (Minimum, Maximum, and Average) Using Arrays in C

📖 Description

This C program reads a set of temperature values from the user and calculates:

✅ Minimum temperature

✅ Maximum temperature

✅ Average temperature

The program uses arrays to store temperature readings and performs statistical calculations using basic looping and conditional statements.

🛠️ Concepts Used

Arrays

Loops (for)

Conditional statements (if)

Basic arithmetic operations

User input using scanf()

Output formatting using printf()

💻 Algorithm

Start the program.

Read the number of temperature readings (n).

Store temperature values in an array.

Initialize min and max with the first element.

Traverse the array:

Update minimum value.

Update maximum value.

Add all elements to calculate sum.

Compute average using:

average = sum / n


Display minimum, maximum, and average values.

Stop the program.
